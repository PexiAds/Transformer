# Transformer
This Crossbrowser creative works as a gallery for your product. it gives you the ability to adapt the content and layout based on the viewport with as many slides as you want

To upload the creative within Pexi you need a Pexi account and access to the correct advertiser. You can request a Pexi account via traffic@pexi.nl. When you have access to Pexi you can upload the banner as a zip (zip the folder, not the files). If you include the IAB size within the filename Pexi will automatically detect and adjust the upload settings.
